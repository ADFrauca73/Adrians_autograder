## Who

## Why
Made for **semi-manually** evaluating student submissions for COSC1020 and COSC130 projects.
This program assists in compiling submissions and entering inputs in a consistent way. User still needs to **manually verify** the correctness of the output generated by students' executables or, if they don't compile, look through error messages to diagnose what went wrong. 

## How (to use)
* Populate `submissions/` folder with student submissions.
* Populate `inputs/` folder with test cases. Each test case consists of some input to be entered into a student's executable. The inputs should be written into a text file, with each separate input separated by whitespace and/or line breaks.
* Run `./autograder`. If need to recompile, use the following command: ` g++ -std=c++17 autograder.cpp -o autograder -lstdc++fs`
* Inspect outputs directory for results of compiling and testing for each submission
